    <h1>life story</h1>
    <p>
      Ever since I was little I loved computers. To me it was like a brand new
      world. I could ride a tank and shoot other tanks. I could build my house
      in minecraft then invite my friends over. The possibilities seemed
      endless, but I wanted to create my own world, that's how I ended up
      coding.

    <h2>my learning journey</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        I started by making games in Unity. My first game was from a tutorial on
        youtube, it was just a cube evading other cubes, but it felt amazing.

        I joined a computer school where I was learning with kids 2 years older
        than me. There I learned basic programming concepts and C#.

        I went on trying to make games, but my art skills weren't the best, so I
        switched to making websites.

      <li>Here I am now still learning and building my own projects.</li>
